This project has 2 main objectives, and one secondary.

It must:

1. Allow users to play RPS over a period of time. Both users do not need to be logged on at the same time to play

1. Absolutely no personal data. That means no user login system, Passwords, E-Mails, etc.

Further, while doing this, it would be a great opportunity to log and track results. It might be fun to train a neural net later on with it.

_It's still not complete yet_
