This is a simple site that will allow me to crush my friends at RPS.

As of now, it's just a prototype and **everything** is going to need to be re-written.

It also logs the results so I can train a Neural Net later (Well at-least its going to).

_This page is really just for me and and maybe a friend or two to practice web programming and GitHub_
