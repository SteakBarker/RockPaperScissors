			<h3>How to use</h3>
			<p>Once you join a game, you will see 3 things:</p>
			<p>The status at the top of the page. It should say something like 'PENDING', 'WON' or 'LOST'. It tells you your current status. Pending means you're waiting on the other player to make their move. </p>
			<p>[NAME] vs [NAME]. Your name is always on the left, and on the right is who you're battling. </p>
			
			<h3>Personal Link</h3>
			<p>When you create a game, you are given a personal link. That is a link for your eyes only. Click/Use your personal link to join the game and play. Keep it private, otherwise people can play as you!</p>
			<p>The personal link contains two things: GameID, UserID. The userID is what is important -- its how the server verifys you are a player or not, and who you are</p>
			
			<h3>Joining A Game</h3>
			<p>If you're given a link, you can use that link to quickly join. However, if you're just given a GameID (Example:4209), you can use the Join game page and simply enter your GameID and your name and join</p>
			
			<h3>Open Games</h3>
			<p>Open games are games no-one has joined yet. You can view all the open games, and join anyone you fancy</p>

			<hr>
			<p>This site was going to be a project I worked on with a friend, by they never ended up working on it with me. Evidence of that still exists -- its why its open source.</p>
			<p>The project had two goals: <br> 1) Users should be able to play a game of RPS over a period of time. Both users did/do not need to be connected to play  <br> 2) No personal data. That means no user login system, E-Mail, passwords, etc. </p>
